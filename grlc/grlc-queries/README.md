# grlc-queries

A repository for the [grlc queries](https://grlc.io) that will be used for the EJP-RD Virtual Platform integration of the World Duchenne Organization.

# Queries explained

- _count_ : The Virtual Platform's first use case was to retrieve a count of the number of disease-code-matching patients within participating repositories. This is the query that should provide this answer for all VP participants.

- _phenotype-frequencies_ : This query retrieves a count of the number of patients within participating repositories that have had a phenotype code at any time.
